react
=====

watch a file, when it changes, react.

usage
=====
./react <file to watch> <command to run>


todo
====

* currently we're only watching file content modifications, handle other types as well (open, close, attr move, delete)
* what do if file moves? keep watching? exit? probably an option for either.
